**Improving Online Learning Through Course Design: A Microeconomic Approach (2021, Draft Coming Soon)**  
<div style="text-align: justify"> <font size="-0.5"> Online education has expanded dramatically over the past two decades, yet significant learning challenges remain. In light of those challenges, this paper provides the first microeconomic analysis to examine how the quality of online university courses can be enhanced through course design, addressing the twin needs of providing individualized support to students and keeping them engaged with online coursework. First, I gather rich data covering over 3,500 undergraduates in an online introductory programming course at a large public university.  The data allow me to monitor students' study time precisely and to characterize important dimensions of heterogeneity: student attentiveness and whether they are forward-looking. I then conduct two randomized informational interventions, nudging students to utilize an online discussion board more fully and complete online assignments.  I find that an additional 4.5 weeks of discussion board utilization increases final exam grades by 0.07 SD and completing one extra online assignment (out of 10 in total) raises final grades by 0.18 SD. I then develop and estimate a behavioural model of student effort supply, credibly identifying the marginal benefits and costs of effort at each stage of the cumulative learning process using the two field experiments. The estimated model allows me to explore the efficacy of changing assignment grading weights to improve student learning. In contrast to the actual (equally-weighted) grading scheme, simulated weights that maximize learning are decreasing across assignments, serving to increase effort by myopic students early in the course when they acquire foundational skills. My course-design approach is applicable more generally in other online and traditional course settings. </font> </div>
