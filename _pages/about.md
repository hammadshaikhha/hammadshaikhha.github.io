I completed my PhD in Economics at the University of Toronto. My research interests are in Public Economics, Behavioural Economics, Applied Econometrics, and the Economics of Education.

My research focuses on improving academic outcomes of students in higher education, studying the effects of supportive leadership on their employees, and social integeration of foreigners. 

Upcoming conference presentations: CEA 2025 (May 23, Montreal) and SOLE 2025 (June 27, Toronto)
