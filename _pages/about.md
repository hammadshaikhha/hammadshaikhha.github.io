I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Toronto. My research interests are in Public Economics, Behavioural Economics, Applied Econometrics, and the Economics of Education.

My research focuses on improving the design of foundational university courses with an emphasis on online education. I use evidence from field experiments and estimatable models of student effort choice to improve students' academic outcomes. 

I will be joining the [University of Stavanger Business School](https://www.uis.no/en/university-of-stavanger-business-school) in the Fall of 2022 as an Assistant Professor of Economics.
