I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Toronto. My research interests are in Public Economics, Behavioural Economics, Applied Econometrics, and Economics of Education.

My research focuses on improving the design of foundational university courses with an emphasis on online education. I use evidence from field experiments and estimatable models of student effort choice to improve students' academic outcomes. 

I am on the 2021-2022 job market and will be will be available for interviews during the CEEE, EJME, and ASSA virtual meetings.
